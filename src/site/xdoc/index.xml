				RtspProxy is a proxy server for multimedia streaming
				services based on the
				<a href="http://www.rtsp.org">RTSP</a>
				protocol.
			</p>

			<p>
				The current version is a complete rewrite from scratch
				in Java of previous versions based on C++. The goal is
				to build a robust and scalable system usable in 
				production environment.
			</p>

			<p>
				The proxy is based on an asynchronous network framework,
				<a
					href="http://directory.apache.org/subprojects/network">
					Apache MINA
				</a>	, which is built on Java NIO. This framework does permit
				to RtspProxy to handle high loads and concurrent users.

				name="24 Oct 2005 - Released RtspProxy 3.0-ALPHA1">
				<p>
					The first release of the brand new Java based
					RtspProxy branch has been released.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please keep aware that this is nothing more than a 
					"<i>Technology Preview</i>"
					to test the new proxy architecture. Implemented
					features are reduced to minimal. At now the proxy works 
					for RTP over UDP streaming sessions.
