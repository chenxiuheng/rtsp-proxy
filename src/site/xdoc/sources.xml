			<p>
				In order to compile the sources, you will need the
				<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a>
				tool. This is a tool that assist in project management,
				builds and releases and it is especially tailored to
				Java projects. Please refer to its website for
				installing and configuring it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have Maven configured and working you can
				compile the project simply by doing:
			</p>
			<source>$ mvn</source>
			<p>in the base project folder.</p>
			<p>
				This will produce, if there are no problems, a folder
				named
				<code>
					target/rtspproxy-<i>[version]</i>-default
				</code>
				containing the binaries.
			</p>

			<p>To generate the documentation, just enter:</p>
			<source>$ mvn site</source>
			<p>
				Documentation will be put under
				<code>target/site</code>
				directory.
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Eclipse">
				<p>
					If you want to import the project into 
					<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, you can generate 
					the project files using:
				</p>
				<source>$ mvn eclipse:eclipse</source>
				<p>
					Also, be sure to check that the <code>M2_REPO</code> variable 
					is defined in Eclipse. If not, set it to the path of your
					Maven repository which in Unix systems is usually located
					in 
					<code>~/.m2/repository</code>.
