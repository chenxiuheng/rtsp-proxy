			<subsection name="What is RtspProxy">
				<p>
					It is a proxy server that works with the RTSP
					protocol in multimedia streaming reproduction. RTSP
					(Real Time Streaming Protocol) is an emerging
					protocol for "session initiation" scopes, its
					purpose is to establish the conditions of an
					audio-video streaming session. The streaming data is
					then sent over other channels using other protocol
					such as RTP (Real Time Protocol).
				</p>
				<p>
					Using a RTSP proxy does permits to access multimedia
					content without the need of being
					<i>directly</i>
					connected to the internet, for example being behind
					a corporate firewall.
