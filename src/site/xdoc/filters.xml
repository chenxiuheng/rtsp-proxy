				<p>
					The RtspProxy is capable of restricting access only
					to authorized clients. This access control scheme is
					completeley separated from the server access control
					because it's proxy specific.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the server ask for authentication to give access
					to media content, the two access control layers will
					work together, providing a two step authentication.
					The proxy will forward client authorization data to
					the server in order to obtain itself access to
					protected contents.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two possible access control schemes that
					can be enabled at the proxy level, one based on
					user/password data sent by client and the other that
					use the client IP address or host name.
